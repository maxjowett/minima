A minimal status bar for macOS, that __displays the _active and available_ workspaces.__ Minima aims to follow macOS style guidelines as much as possible.

## Getting started

Minima requires [Übersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht). In order to to utilize minima's full capabilities, it is intended to integrate with [yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) and [skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd), however using it without either works fine as well.

The following snippet assumes your Übersicht widgets folder is located in the default location:

```
git clone https://github.com/maxjowett/minima "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Übersicht/widgets/minima"
```

:construction: Minima is very much a work in progress!
